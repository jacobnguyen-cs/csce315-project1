  <h1>Jacob Nguyen</h1>

    <p>I am a student at Texas A&M University studying computer engineering. A couple of hobbies of mine are 
      playing games and bouldering. The game that I have played the longest is League of Legends which I have been 
      playing for 10 years now. Bouldering is a hobby that I have recently picked up and one I find hard to keep 
      up with. The highest grade I have been able to climb is V4 and my goal is to climb at least a V6 by the end of 
      this year. Another goal I have is to be able to land a software engineering job after I graduate since I am 
      passionate about computer science. My portfolio includes some of the projects that I have completed throughout 
      my college career but the one I am most proud of is my web development project. This project was for a database 
      class in which my team and I decided to create a website that would be able to interact with our database.
