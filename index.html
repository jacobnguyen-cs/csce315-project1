    <p>
      I am a student at Texas A&M University studying computer engineering. A couple 
      of hobbies of mine are playing games and bouldering. The game that I have played 
      the longest is League of Legends which I have been playing for 10 years now. 
      Bouldering is a hobby that I have recently picked up and one I find hard to keep 
      up with as you must be consistent to improve. The highest grade I have been able 
      to climb is V4 and my goal is to climb at least a V6 by the end of this year. Another
       goal I have is to be able to land a software engineering job after I graduate since 
       I am passionate about computer science. My portfolio includes some of the projects 
       that I have completed throughout my college career but the one I am most proud of is 
       the website my team and I created. This project was for a database class in which my 
       team and I decided to create a website that would be able to interact with our database. 
       The websites front end was done using Vue while we used Express and PostgreSQL on the 
       back end. My experience from this course is limited to the project that my team and I 
       completed which is why I am seeking a web development role working on the front end of 
       an application. Other projects that I have completed have been in C++ which is the main 
       language I have been using throughout college. I am interested to see what else  C++ can 
       do which is why I am open to other software engineering roles. A course I am currently 
       taking is computer graphics and I find it interesting as I have been playing games most 
       of my life. Being able to do projects that are similar to all the games I have played may 
       spark a passion for game development in the future but I would like to focus on one goal 
       at a time.
