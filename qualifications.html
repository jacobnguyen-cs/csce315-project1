      <p>
        I have a strong proficiency in C++ as it is the language I use for all my school 
        work. I have also completed a full-stack project using <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue.js</a>, 
        <a href="https://expressjs.com/">Express</a>, and <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a>.
        These skills demonstrate my ability to work with both front-end and back-end technologies
        to create dynamic web applications. You can learn more about the projects I have completed
        from my <a href="Resume.pdf" attributes-list download>resume.</a> My area of interest is in
        web development as I enjoy creating and designing pieces to create a bigger picture.
