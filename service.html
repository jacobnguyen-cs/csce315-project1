    <h3>Philsa</h3>
    <p>
      During my first year of college I joined an organization called <a href="https://www.philsa.org/">Philsa</a> 
      where I did some volunteer work. I did concessions at the Texas A&M football games with other members from Philsa
      in which the earnings went to the organization. Although I am not Filipino I enjoyed learning more about the culture
      of the Philippines.

    <h3>Ways to Give Back</h3>
    <p>
      For my last semester at Texas A&M, I plan on becoming a <a href="https://engineering.tamu.edu/cse/academics/peer-teachers/index.html">peer teacher</a> 
      for the CSCE department. I hope to help other students as I have been helped before many times when I took computer science courses. With the experience and
      knowledge I have gained from these courses, I hope to give a better understanding to those who may not grasp the concepts
      of computer science.
